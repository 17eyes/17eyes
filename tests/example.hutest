-- The script tools/hutest2hs converts this file to Haskell sources by putting
-- all file contents to a top-level String called 'thisSource'. It can be
-- accessed from the code in this file.

-- It also predefines two functions 'assertIssue' and 'assertNoIssue' using
-- TestHelper's 'createIssueAsserts'. See tools/TestHelper.hs for details
-- about using these assertions.
