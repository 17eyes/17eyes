General Information
===================

Our test code is a simple GNU Makefile which has defined few targets:

tests $ make help

test
test_parser_only
test_hunit_only
test_unparser_only
clean
failed
summary            

tests $ make test_parser_only

ID: TESTID=20150529103756
Test cases: 11003
OK: 10857
Failed: 146

Please make sure to use gmake(1) on BSD systems. We used that tests as a
specification what we want to implement (and how sensitive 17eyes should be).
Targets defined in Makefile should be self-descriptive. You can use -j switch
for tests parallelization.

Name conventions
================

Filenames starts with warn_*.php should emit issues. good_*.php are correct
and SHOULD not return false positives.

Contents of selected directories:
=================================

bare_strings: undeclared constants (which are treat as strings by default)
control_flow: control flow analysis (functions, includes, ...)
eof_junk: junk after "?>"
lossy_coercion: implict lossy type coercion (i.e. "7 days" (string) --> 7 (int))
parser: bunch of tests from the PHP project ripped to test our parser/unparser
stdlib: PHP standard library calls (unsafe functions, parameters count, ...)
undefined: undefined variables, functions, methods
